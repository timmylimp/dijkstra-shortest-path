# Dijkstra Shortest Path

<p>Please create a C# library that provides an implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm using a priority queue.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can decide on an appropriate method signature / graph data structure.</li>
<li>You do not need to implement your own priority queue data structure.</li>
<li>Please include good unit tests</li>
<li>Please include good documentation in your code to explain the choices you have made</li>
</ul>
